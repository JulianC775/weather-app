# Weather App Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Overview

Building a React weather application with current weather display and 10-day forecast functionality.

## 📋 Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Priority: High)

### 1.1 API Setup & Configuration

- [ ] Choose and sign up for a weather API (OpenWeatherMap recommended)
- [ ] Get API key and set up environment variables
- [ ] Create API service utilities in `src/services/`
- [ ] Test API connectivity and data structure

### 1.2 Basic Project Structure

- [ ] Create component folder structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── Header/
  │   ├── Forecast/
  │   ├── Search/
  │   └── common/
  ├── services/
  ├── hooks/
  ├── utils/
  └── styles/
  ```
- [ ] Set up basic routing (if needed)
- [ ] Create basic CSS/styling foundation

## 🎨 Phase 2: Core Components (Priority: High)

### 2.1 Header Component (`src/components/Header/`)

**Purpose**: Display current weather information prominently

**Features to implement**:

- [ ] Location display (city, state/country)
- [ ] Current temperature (large, prominent display)
- [ ] Weather condition with appropriate icon
- [ ] Humidity percentage
- [ ] Current date and time (auto-updating)
- [ ] "Feels like" temperature
- [ ] Wind speed and direction
- [ ] Weather condition description

**Technical requirements**:

- [ ] Create `Header.jsx` component
- [ ] Create `Header.css` for styling
- [ ] Implement responsive design
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Handle error states

### 2.2 Forecast Component (`src/components/Forecast/`)

**Purpose**: Display 10-day weather forecast

**Features to implement**:

- [ ] 10-day forecast cards layout
- [ ] Daily high/low temperatures
- [ ] Weather condition icons for each day
- [ ] Precipitation chance percentage
- [ ] Sunrise/sunset times
- [ ] Day of week labels

**Technical requirements**:

- [ ] Create `Forecast.jsx` component
- [ ] Create `ForecastCard.jsx` sub-component
- [ ] Create `Forecast.css` for styling
- [ ] Implement horizontal scrolling for mobile
- [ ] Add loading and error states

## 🔧 Phase 3: Functionality & Integration (Priority: Medium)

### 3.1 API Integration

- [ ] Create `src/services/weatherApi.js`
- [ ] Implement current weather API call
- [ ] Implement forecast API call
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement data caching (optional)

### 3.2 State Management

- [ ] Set up React state for current weather
- [ ] Set up React state for forecast data
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add error handling states
- [ ] Consider using Context API for global state

### 3.3 Location Handling

- [ ] Implement geolocation API for current location
- [ ] Add location search functionality
- [ ] Store user's preferred location
- [ ] Handle location permission errors

## 🎨 Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Priority: Medium)

### 4.1 Search Component (`src/components/Search/`)

- [ ] Location search input
- [ ] Autocomplete suggestions
- [ ] Recent searches history
- [ ] Search results display

### 4.2 Weather Details Component

- [ ] UV index
- [ ] Air pressure
- [ ] Visibility
- [ ] Dew point
- [ ] Detailed wind information

### 4.3 Settings & Preferences

- [ ] Temperature unit toggle (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- [ ] Wind speed unit toggle (mph/kmh)
- [ ] Theme preferences (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Language settings

## 🚀 Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Priority: Low)

### 5.1 Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement React.memo for components
- [ ] Add lazy loading for components
- [ ] Optimize API calls with debouncing
- [ ] Add service worker for offline functionality

### 5.2 User Experience

- [ ] Add smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement skeleton loading screens
- [ ] Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Implement progressive web app features

### 5.3 Testing & Quality

- [ ] Write unit tests for components
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement error boundary
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## 🛠 Technical Stack

### Current Dependencies

- React 19.1.0
- Axios (for API calls)
- React Icons (for weather icons)
- React Scripts (for development)

### Additional Dependencies to Consider

- [ ] `date-fns` (for date formatting)
- [ ] `react-query` (for API state management)
- [ ] `styled-components` or `emotion` (for styling)
- [ ] `react-router-dom` (if multi-page routing needed)

## 📱 Responsive Design Considerations

### Mobile First Approach

- [ ] Design for mobile screens first
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Optimize for portrait orientation
- [ ] Ensure fast loading on slow connections

### Desktop Enhancements

- [ ] Add hover effects
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Optimize for larger screens
- [ ] Add detailed tooltips

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Set up weather API account** and get API key
2. **Create basic component structure** (Header and Forecast folders)
3. **Implement API service** to fetch weather data
4. **Build Header component** with current weather display
5. **Test with real data** and debug any issues

## 📝 Notes & Ideas

### Weather API Options

- **OpenWeatherMap**: Free tier, good documentation
- **WeatherAPI.com**: Simple pricing, good data
- **AccuWeather**: Comprehensive data, paid service

### Design Inspiration

- Consider using weather-appropriate color schemes
- Use weather icons that match the actual conditions
- Implement smooth transitions between weather states
- Add micro-interactions for better UX

### Future Enhancements

- Weather alerts and notifications
- Historical weather data
- Weather maps integration
- Social sharing features
- Weather-based recommendations (clothing, activities)
